# Decision Tree Classification - Heart Disease Dataset

This repository is focused on implementing **Decision Tree Classification** on the `heart_disease.csv` dataset.  
The assignment demonstrates the full machine learning workflow including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

---

## Objective
To apply Decision Tree Classification for predicting heart disease presence, evaluate model performance using various metrics, and interpret the decision tree rules.  
This assignment provides hands-on practice with supervised learning and model interpretability.
